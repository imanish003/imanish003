# My WooCommerce Contributions

## Overview

As a Senior JavaScript Engineer at Automattic (Woo Division) from September 2022 to April 2025, I spearheaded critical initiatives for WooCommerce Blocks, transforming the platform's visual editing capabilities. I led development of the [Product Collection block](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-store-editing/customizing-shop-page-catalog/product-collection-block/) from concept to stable release, which became WooCommerce's flagship solution replacing ten legacy blocks and achieving the highest adoption rate in the ecosystem. I designed and implemented an extensibility framework that empowered third-party developers to create custom product collections, authored [comprehensive documentation](https://developer.woocommerce.com/docs/block-development/product-collection-block/register-product-collection), and resolved complex technical challenges. My work directly improved the merchant experience by enabling them to create sophisticated, conversion-optimized online stores without requiring coding knowledge.

## Key Achievements

### Product Collection Block

I served as the Directly Responsible Individual (DRI) for the Product Collection block, guiding its development from experimental to beta (August 2023) and finally to stable release (June 2024). This strategic block became the [default solution in WooCommerce 9.5](https://developer.woocommerce.com/2024/11/19/product-collection-block-the-new-default/), replacing ten older blocks:

- All Products
- Best Selling Products
- Handpicked Products
- Newest Products
- On Sale Products
- Top Rated Products
- Related Products (based on Query Loop)
- Products by Tag
- Products by Category
- Products by Attribute

The block's adoption metrics confirm its success, **becoming the most widely used product display block in the ecosystem**, validating our strategy of consolidating product display functionality into a single, powerful, and extensible solution.

### Extensibility Framework

I [designed and implemented](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/pull/48141) an extensibility framework for the Product Collection block, enabling third-party developers to create custom collections. This included exposing the necessary APIs and creating [comprehensive documentation](https://developer.woocommerce.com/docs/block-development/product-collection-block/register-product-collection), empowering third-party developers to build solutions like "Frequently Bought Together," "Recently Viewed," and other custom product displays.
